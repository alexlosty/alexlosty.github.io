                <p>Since I'm shifting my main focus from motion design & editing, here's a glimpse of my skills in the field. I made this Destiny 2 themed video (and song) in my spare time, and it's a perfect showcase for how much dedication I can put into big projects. I would be happy to work on editing game trailers in addition to composing music.</p>
